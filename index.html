    <h1>Sentiment Analysis of Political Commentary on Reddit</h1>
    <div id="first"><img id="logos" src="img/logos.png">
      <p>This project was the subject of my dissertation that I completed in 2020. The aim of the project was to analyse the
      sentiment of posts made to the website Reddit. I took the opportunity to work on this project because of my interest in
      politics, as well as the potential to develop my knowledge in machine learning. This was the right decision as it
      inspired me to work on many other projects in the field, and to date I am continuing to build on the experience I gained
      here.</p>
      <p>I began this project by developing a program to interact with Reddit's API using the Python Reddit API Wrapper. I
      generated my own training data by getting the top posts from both the r/Republican and r/Democrats subreddits, and
      saving them to a JSON file. The idea here being that we could train some sort of machine learning algorithm to
      distinguish between the title of a post made to the r/Republican subreddit as compared to a post made to the r/Democrats
      subreddit, and use this model to classify other subreddits that focus on political commentary.</p>
      <p>Once I had this data I got to work on developing a neural network with TensorFlow to classify the data. I went with a
      Long-Short Term Memory network structure, which is a good choice for text classification and sequential data (although
      has been overtaken in popularity by CNNs and most notably Transformer network structures as of late). I used
      Keras tuner for hyperparameter optimisation but this did not improve the performance much at all. The model achieved
      around 70% validation accuracy, which is pretty good considering the lack of training data I had available through the
      API and the quality of the data as well (some titles were only a few words long so understandably there wasn't much
      information for the neural network to work off).</p>

      <p>After the network was trained, I selected a set of subreddits from across the political spectrum to be used for
      classification. The network evaluated the top 100 or so posts for each subreddit and gave each a score for sentiment, 1 for
      Republican, 0 for Democrat. I also used a library called TextBlob to get a score for polarity (how positive or negative
      the posts were) and included the number of subscribers each subreddit had in the statistics as well.</p>
      <p>I plotted the statistics saved in a JSON file with Chartjs, as seen above, where the x and y direction represents each subreddits
      sentiment and polarity scores, and the size of each data point represents the size of the user base. Supplemental statistics
      are also provided for what the users of each subreddit are also interested in by clicking on an individual subreddit's data
      point.</p>
